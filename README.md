## Summary: Updated 7/31/2017
AATT or, Admin ALL THE THINGS! Is a free and open-source AutHotKey based program written to leverage PSTools in a GUI oriented manner. This allows for quick administrative and arbitrary tasks to be deployed and run on remote computers. 

This program was originally written to assist with the XP to Windows 7 refresh of a former client of mine, and has been cleaned and generalized to work with any network. 

##### Program is currently in PRE-ALPHA RELEASE


### Features: Updated 7/31/2017

>  * GUI based list-driven computer management! 
>  * One button features!
>  * Gui for PStools
>  * Custom AHK based Chat application! (for those pesky clients that don't have skype or some sort of chat tool)
>  * One button user Messaging! 
>  * Remote Windows 7 updating! (WSUS compatible!)



**Requirements:**

  * Domain Admin or local admin credentials

## Instructions

  * No instructions currently avaliable 
  * Contact the maintainer or leave a bug report to get help! 


**Wishlist:**

  * More testing! 
  * Powershell interoperability
  * Local admin capability (need to put a switch somewhere) 
  * Better password encryption and a way to protect secrets at rest!
  * A better solution than PSTools which sends passwords in plain text
